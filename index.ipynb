    "# Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we learned about Measures of central tendency - mean, median and mode. These metrics help give us a general understanding of where the values lie in the range of our data. However, they don't tell us the whole picture, and can often be misleading. \n",
    "\n",
    "To truly understand our data, we also need **Measures of Dispersion**, namely, Absolute Deviation, Standard Deviation and Variance. These measures tell us how tightly or loosely clustered around the center our data is, and generally act as a measure of how \"noisy\" our dataset is or isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn about these measures of dispersion, and explore the relationship between them, as well as their relationship with other summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Describe the significance of calculating measures of dispersion for continuous data\n",
    "- Understand the formula and intuition behind mean absolute deviation, standard deviation, and variance\n",
    "- Understand the formula and intuition behind quantiles/quartiles and percentiles\n",
    "- Understand and interpret Interquartile distances with box plots\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Absolute Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Absolute deviation** is the simplest way of calculating the dispersion in a dataset. This is calculated by taking a value from the data and subtracting the mean score. This helps to identify the distance between a given value and mean i.e. how much the value deviates from the mean -  \n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\left|x_i - \\bar{x}\\right|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Bars are used for absolute values when we are not considering positive vs. negative deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Consider the mean score for the group of 100 students is 58.75 out of 100. If we took a student that scored 60 out of 100, the deviation of a score from the mean is 60 - 58.75 = 1.25. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Average Absolute Deviation** of a dataset is calculated by taking mean of individual deviations of all data elements as shown in the formula below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large \\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\left|(x_i-\\bar x)\\right| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here **$x_i = [x_1, x_2, .., x_n]$** , where n is the number of observations. x-bar is the mean calculated over the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, if two people make 50,000 USD a year and two make 60,000 USD a year, the mean is 55,000 USD and the average absolute deviation is 5,000 USD.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complex measure of dispersion is Variance. Unlike the absolute deviation, which uses the absolute value of the deviation in order to take care of the negative values, the variance achieves positive values by squaring each of the deviations instead. Adding up these squared deviations gives us the **sum of squares**, which we can then divide by the total number of values in our data.  Variance can be calculated with the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\large \\sigma^2 = \\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\\bar x)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the variance (σ2: sigma-squared), is achieved by: \n",
    "* subtracting mean value (shown as mu) from each element in turn\n",
    "* squaring the result (to remove the negative sign) and adding to a total\n",
    "* dividing by total number of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to do that for our four people above, the variance would be:"

    "As a measure of dispersion, the variance is very useful. If the values in the data are spread out, the variance will be a large number. On the other hand, if the values are spread closely around the mean, the variance will be a much smaller number. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, two potential problems with the variance. Firstly, because the deviations of values from the mean are 'squared', this gives more weight to extreme scores. Outliers in the data can also impact variance. Secondly, the variance is not in the same units as the values in our data set. Variance is measured in the units **squared**. This means we cannot directly relate variance value to the values in our data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the standard deviation rather than the variance rectifies this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is another measure of the spread of values within a set of data. \n",
    "It is simply the square root of the variance. In the above formula, $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\large \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\\mu)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *$\\mu$ (mu) is the true mean and $\\bar x$ is the arithmetic mean. For this purpose, we can think of them as essentially the same. However, in mathematical terms, $\\bar x$ is our sample mean and $\\mu$ is the true population mean.*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the common applications of calculating standard deviation is statistical inference.  we are often presented with data from a sample only, we can estimate the population standard deviation from a sample standard deviation. These two standard deviations - sample and population standard deviations - are calculated slightly differently as we shall see ahead. \n"

    "## Quantiles, Percentiles, and Quartiles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantiles** are points in a distribution that relates to the rank order of values in that distribution. We can find any quantile by sorting the sample. The middle value of the sorted sample (middle quantile, 50th percentile) is known as the **median**. The **limits** are the **minimum** and **maximum**  values. Any other locations between these points can be described in terms of **percentiles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentiles are descriptions of quantiles relative to 100. So the 80th percentile is 80%  of the way up an ascending list of sorted values of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/percent.svg)\n",

    "## InterQuartile Range - IQR\n",
    "The **quartiles** of a data set divide the data into four equal parts, with one-fourth of the data values in each part. The second quartile position is the median of the data set, which divides the data set in half as shown for a simple dataset below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/quartilebox.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **interquartile range (IQR)** is a measure of where the “middle fifty” is in a data set. Where a range is a measure of where the beginning and end are in a set, an interquartile range is a measure of where the bulk of the values lie. That’s why it’s preferred over many other measures of spread (i.e. the average or median) when reporting things like average retirement age and scores in a test etc. \n",
